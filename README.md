**How It's Made:**
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

The tic-tac-toe game is built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles are integrated into the JavaScript codebase to ensure modularity and reusability of components. Event listeners capture user input, and dynamic manipulation of the DOM (Document Object Model) updates the tic-tac-toe game display. CSS is utilized to achieve visually appealing and responsive design across different devices.

**Lessons Learned:**
**User-Centric Approach**:  By focusing on array manipulation, debugging skills, project organization, and conducting rigorous testing and feedback, I've realized the paramount importance of adopting a user-centric design approach. Prioritizing these optimizations can significantly enhance usability, accessibility, and overall user satisfaction. Additionally, integrating features like AI/ML into the game can broaden its appeal, providing users with the option to play against AI when another player isn't available.
